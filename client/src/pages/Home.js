          <h1>About Us</h1>
          Commerce City Youth Athletics is a non-profit organization. We as a league are committed to honesty, integrity and a commitment to provide low cost registration fees so that as many as possible youth children may join the sport we provide. We offer a girlsâ€™ traveling softball team. We are able to provide the program through registration fees, fundraisers, and donations. All officers and coaches are non-paid volunteers.
          <br />
          <br />

          No one involved in our program receives payment for the time, energy and services they provide to CCYA.
          Our Coaches, Team Parents, Committee members and Board members take time away from their families to donate many hours a week to our organization. We hope that each and every one of you appreciates all that they give to our children. Please remember we are NOT a CITY operated or funded program.
          We conduct very important fundraisers for our organization every year, that without, we would have to raise our registration fees. The money raised is used to pay for the equipment, uniforms that we purchase, as well as the cost of team fees, etc.
          <br />
